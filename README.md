**Functional-Data-Analysis**
This is a very generic and remarkably versatile
topic whose application includes in variety of fields such as</br>
Bio-medical data - Psychometric, Medical tests, Drug discovery</br>
Electronics - testing electronic chips, sensing and monitoring equipments etc.</br>
Geography - Seismology, Meteorology</br>
and many more fields...</br>
Analysing the data helps to highlight various characteristic and explain variation
in outcome. Learning the pattern & variation among the data and integrating
it in various application aspects could be the next cutting edge technology.

The project is implemented in python

**Why FDA ?**
Why do I need a curve that fits the functional data points?</br>
We can study various characterstic of curves. The changes are nearly smooth in data if we have
that resolution in data. So, after getting the curves from thousands of data we can classify all
those curves on the basis of various characterstic. This project is for the automation of whole idea.

Example 1 : If the input is the temperature of different regions of the world, it will make classes 
of the cities showing similar characterstic and variation. </br>
Class 1 : {Mumbai, India} : cities where the temperature is almost constant throughtout the year</br>
Class 2 : {Toronto, Canada} : cities where the temperature falls down to -20 deg Celcius</br>
Class 3 : {Ahmedabad, India} : cities where the temperature reaches extremes in all the three seasons</br>
